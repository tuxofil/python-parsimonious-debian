Description: The fastest pure-Python PEG parser I can muster
 Parsimonious aims to be the fastest arbitrary-lookahead parser written
 in pure Pythonâ€”and the most usable. It's based on parsing expression
 grammars (PEGs), which means you feed it a simplified sort of EBNF
 notation. Parsimonious was designed to undergird a MediaWiki parser
 that wouldn't take 5 seconds or a GB of RAM to do one page, but it's
 applicable to all sorts of languages.
